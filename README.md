# ClassPairs
I was challenged by the professor for whom I was a Teacher's Assistant to make a program that will pair up the students for classwork with a couple restrictions:
* Students who sit at the same table can't be paired together
* Students who've worked together previously can't work together again

And with that, here is the result!
